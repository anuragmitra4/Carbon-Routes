# Carbon-Routes

Carbon Routes is an Android App which lets users track their personal contribution to the world pollution. The goal of the app is to make people reflect on the decisions they make throughout the day which affect the environment in small but significant ways. Built this application using Android Studio based on Java and used Sketch to design an interactive, visually-pleasing UI for the app. By tracking the distance one travels in a motorized vehicle using Google Maps API, and by tracking the amount of plastic used by the user in a day, the app quantifies the results in the form of a Carbon Routes Score. Researched on the possible effects of pollution based on distance travelled and the mode of transportation availed to design an algorithm for the Carbon Routes score.
